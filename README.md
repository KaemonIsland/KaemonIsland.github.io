## Hello!

This is the beginning of my Portfolio Website.
Currently only the navigation bar has been created, as a template. The social media links work correctly, however nothing else does.

This is a new project to show all that I have accomplished while learning to become a Front End Web Developer. I have many projects that I hope to upgrade with a new touch of personality, not to mention upgrade with me current knowledge.

## Goals!

This Application is going to be a single page app with a navigation bar that can be expanded and reduced by clicking on an arrow that will hover along the side.

As the user clicks on the project links, there will be a series of Photos and text boxes aligned in a fun way of using CSS Grid. The photos will show the development of each of my projects along with what features I have implemented, and challenges I had along the way.

## Projects!

Stage Index: is a not so well named application that works with the Spotify API. The user can search Spotifies song-base and add them to a "playlist". The User can then create that playlist on their Spotify account.

Make this (deck) Great: I love Magic the Gathering, but I am not good at knowing what cards are out, and what cards I currently have in my collection. With Make this (deck) Great! The user will be able to search an API database containing all of the Magic The Gathering cards in existence. The user can search by a card name, type, color, rarity, and set, and then a grid will be populated with card images that one can manipulate, and view all details. 
The user will also be able to add cards to a Deck, Eventually using a back-end node server and Posgresql as the database to save built decks. I want to go all in in this application.

Face It: This is an application made along with Andeis course on Udemy. It works with Clarifais API, to view a photo, and draw a square around an individuals face. I wish to reconfigure and upgrade this application to the max! It will be able to find multiple faces, along with other pictures that the Clarifai API can do.

Etc: I plan on also making a page that will hold various one of concepts that I've completed in challenges or practice. Stuff like: converting numbers to Roman Numerals, Converting hexidecimal colors to RGB colors, or changing various shades.

If you have any ideas or would like to collaborate with me, let me know! I love constructive feedback! Just don't be mean!
